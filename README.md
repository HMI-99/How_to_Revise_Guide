# 📘 How to Revise Guide (Work in Progress)

A student-friendly, honest, and practical revision guide designed to support GCSE learners with developing confidence in their core subjects — starting with English Language and Literature.

## ✍️ What This Is

This is not your typical revision guide.

It's a work-in-progress educational resource created from lived experience. Written by me, Hajira Ammen Mir, this guide blends personal insight, teaching experience, and real examples to help students revise in a way that works for *them* — not just what the system expects.

The guide walks through:
- How I learned to revise through trial and error
- Techniques that worked (and why)
- Subject-specific advice starting with English
- Personal reflections from both student and teacher perspectives
- A mindset-first approach to exams

## 💡 Why I’m Making This

I used to constantly ask myself: *how do I revise?* I didn’t always have the answer — and many of my students didn’t either. This guide is built from that place of not knowing, and learning through doing.

Alongside my current journey into data science and digital content creation, I’m building this resource as part of a broader educational toolkit that includes:
- A TikTok study-based community
- A GCSE revision dataset
- A content engagement tracker
- This evolving revision guide

## 📚 What's Inside (So Far)

- ✅ Personal story and revision philosophy
- ✅ English Language and Literature section (with exam board references and model answers)
- 🛠 Subject expansion in progress
- 🔗 Useful links to specs and resources
- 📈 Planned integration with data insights in future versions

## 🧠 Who This Is For

- GCSE students who want honest, approachable guidance
- Students struggling to find a revision style that fits them
- Anyone who feels overwhelmed and just needs a place to start

## 🚧 Work In Progress

This is an evolving document. I’ll be adding:
- More subjects (Maths, Science, etc.)
- Custom study models and visuals
- A structured index for easier navigation
- Downloadable versions and teacher-friendly formats
